R Markdown of analysis and visualization of plant callose accumulation in response to viral protein variants. Available on: https://brycealex.github.io/Callose-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization/

Figure description: Effect of a single amino acid substitution at position 247 in the helper component proteinase (HCPro) proteins from Potato virus Y (PVY) strains O and N on callose accumulation in PVYO-resistant Premier Russet cultivar. Boxplots and dot plots of callose counts/mm2 in response to the transient expression of the wild type HCPro proteins from PVYO (HCProO) and PVYN (HCProN), and the mutant variants HCProO S247A and HCProN A247S, following treatment with or without flg22, a known callose inducer.Images were captured after 48 hours of HCPro transient expression, and 24 hours following H2O or flg22 treatment. Kruskal & Wallis test (Î± < 0.05) was used to test for statistical  significance.
